# microservice_experience

Here's my playgraund to gather experiences in developing microservices, unknown frameworks and much more.

## swagger_micro
I want to develop a service which which helps me to manage my literature sources like books, pdf's, websites ... It should 
give me informations what citations I have made from which source and in which work I've done that, which topics it was related to,
remarks and so on.

### First Step
I want a running microservice which provides me a REST interface and are documented with the help of swagger.
Here I've used Swagger for the first time and I must say I really like it. With a few lines of code you get an user interface 
where you can easyily test what you have done and show others what your service need and produces. Very nice.
The microservice itself is a Spring Boot application.
