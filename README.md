# microservice_experience


## swagger_micro
This is a  test using Swagger for a Spring Boot Microservice. The service should manage literature sources like books, pdf's, websites ... It should give me informations what citations I have made from which source and in which work I've done that, which topics it was related to,
remarks and so on.
